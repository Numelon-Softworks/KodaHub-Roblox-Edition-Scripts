# KodaHub (Roblox Edition) Scripts
⚠️ **Some scripts are outdated and may not work.**

KodaHub Scripts is an incomplete collection of some of the scripts available in KodaHub for Roblox.

Currently, only the following scripts have been released for public view:
- **Roblox Anti Idle Script (AntiIdle.lua)**
  
  After 20 minutes of inactivity (no keyboard or mouse input/activity), Roblox sets the status to idle and kicks you from the game. This script prevents that.
  
- **Welcome to Bloxburg Automatic Hairdresser Script (AutoHairdresser.lua)**
  
  This script does not function due to Welcome to Bloxburg updates and anti-exploiting measures.

  *Note: The last time this script worked was ~2020/2021.*

## ⛔️ Roblox and Byfron
As of 2023, Roblox has taken a firm stance against cheating and exploiting on its platform. This commitment was emphasised in [a recent blog](https://devforum.roblox.com/t/exploit-prevention-update/2663101) post where Roblox addressed the ongoing battle against unauthorised activities and announced a strategic partnership with Synapse Softworks LLC.

### Roblox's Stance on Cheating and Exploiting

In a blog post, Roblox declared its unwavering dedication to combating cheating and exploiting within the Roblox ecosystem. The company highlighted recent ban waves that resulted in the removal of hundreds of thousands of players engaging in such activities. Moreover, Roblox expressed its determination to continue these ban waves until a positive shift in player behavior is observed.

### A Strategic Partnership with Synapse Softworks LLC

In an unexpected move, Roblox announced a close partnership with Synapse Softworks LLC, a well-known entity in the reverse engineering scene. Synapse is recognized for its expertise in understanding the security challenges posed by exploiting activities. The partnership aims to leverage Synapse's skills and knowledge to reinforce the platform's security and mitigate potential threats.

While the collaboration may seem unconventional given the historical opposition, Roblox emphasized that the partnership with Synapse is a strategic move toward achieving the overarching goal of making Roblox the most trusted, safe, and fair environment possible. The partnership is viewed as a significant step forward in bridging the gap between the platform and the reverse engineering community.

### Encouraging Reform and Bug Bounty Program

Roblox expressed a willingness to work with individuals and entities interested in contributing to a safer and fairer Roblox platform. The company encouraged users to share relevant information through its Bug Bounty program, providing an avenue for responsible disclosure and cooperation.

### Synapse's Role in Security Enhancement

As part of the partnership, Synapse will collaborate closely with Roblox in analyzing security issues and developing effective countermeasures. The blog post expressed confidence in Synapse's capabilities and welcomed the opportunity to work together toward shared security goals.

In summary, the collaboration between Roblox and Synapse represents a unique alliance aimed at fortifying the platform's security measures and fostering a safer and more equitable gaming environment.
